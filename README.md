**MoodBeats AI – Mood‑Based Music**

**Recommendation Chatbot**

MoodBeats AI is a lightweight music recommendation chatbot built using the Dify platform. It generates five personalized song suggestions based on the user’s emotional state. The bot uses a dynamic {mood} variable, allowing it to adapt instantly to any mood entered by the user.

The system prompt uses Few‑Shot Prompting, providing example mood‑to‑song lists that teach the model the correct structure and tone. This ensures the chatbot always returns a clean, numbered list of five fresh, non‑repetitive recommendations with no extra explanations.
This project demonstrates effective prompt engineering, variable handling, and chatbot design within Dify.

**Features:**
- Mood‑based music recommendations
- Exactly 5 songs per response
- Few‑Shot Prompting for consistent output
- Simple, user‑friendly interaction
